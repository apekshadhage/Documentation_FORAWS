# Introduction

Infoview Systems AS400Gateway suite of products eliminates the stress and impact of IBM i / AS400 legacy system integration on development teams, minimizes the time and resources put into building integrations by hand, and enables non-IBM i developers to unlock legacy business logic and data directly from the comfort of their modern integration development stack. AS400Gateway for AWS is an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that provides generic REST API integration for IBM i operations (Program call, Service Program call, Command call, Data Queue Read and Write). In addition the product can be configured to continuously listen for Data Queue messages and forward them to AWS SQS or SNS for further processing.

The product provides a convenient out of the box IBM i integration capabilities for companies running their enterprise integrations on AWS stack. Certified and rigorously tested by AWS marketplace team, the connector was designed to accelerate IBM i / AS400 integrations with other systems and services. In addition to the core product available to customers in AMI format, we also provide a reference AWS architecture that includes a sample API and event based use cases.

# AS400Gateway for AWS Overview

The IBM AS/400 was first introduced in 1988 and evolved into a very stable modern all-purpose integrated solution that requires little or no management. The system is able to run core line of business applications securely and predictably, focusing on quality of service and availability and offering a compelling total cost of ownership for integrated on-premises solutions. IBM made several changes to the server and OS name (iSeries, System i, IBM i, Power Systems for i) but most still refer to it as AS/400.

The IBM i platform offers a number of integration options including PHP, Java, WebSphere, specialized lightweight web service containers, FTP, SMTP / emails, DB2 interfaces, data queues, integrated file systems - IFS, as well as number of products offered by IBM and Third party vendors. The main benefit of using &quot;native&quot; options such as Program Calls and Data Queues is that integration or cloud development team does not have to acquire in-depth knowledge of IBM i technologies in order to build integration layer, and can easily communicate with external systems using only traditional development tools.

Program Call is the most straightforward and low code option for exposing IBM i business logic as a reusable API. The AS400Gateway for AWS provides a generic API interface to call any program on IBM i, passing parameters into the program and receiving the results back in real time.

Data queues are native IBM i objects designed primarily for inter-process communications. They are lightweight persistent queues that support processing by a key, FIFO or LIFO. The majority of integration use cases can be implemented with the pair of request and response Data Queues. Source system places a message to request data queue and waits for acknowledgement message on response data queue. The target system receives and processes a message from the request data queue then places the acknowledgement to the response data queue.

The AS400Gateway for AWS provides the REST API to read or write the messages into Data Queue on demand, or continuously listen for new Data Queue messages and forward to AWS SQS / SNS in near real time.

# IBM i Prerequisites

- IBM i OS version:V5R4 and higher
- AWS VPC where the AMI is running must be able to reach the IBM i servers on ports 446, 449, 8470, 8472,8473,8475 and 8476 for non-SSL communications, and ports 448, 449, 9470, 9472, 9473, 9475 and 9476 accessible for SSL communications.
- IBM i must have **\*CENTRAL, \*DTAQ, \*RMTCMD, \*SIGNON and \*SRVMAP** host servers running in the QSYSWRK subsystem
- If secure TLS connection is used, the TLS certificate must be applied to Central, Data Queue, Remote Command, File, Signon, and DDM / DRDA services in Digital Certificate Manager
- IBM i user ID must be authorized to perform the operations on the intended IBM i objects
- If there&#39;s an additional security software that locks down the remote execution functionality, the IBM i user ID defined for connector configuration must be allowed to execute remote calls and access database, IFS and DDM services

# AWS Reference Architecture

Below is a sample AWS architecture that includes various services and components typically used when implementing cloud integration solution for bidirectional integrations with IBM i based back-end systems.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88314020/165104309-cde0f780-ac9d-4512-aad2-bda005bfc01f.png)



Salesforce is used as a sample external system that sends orders to IBM i based ERP and receives order statuses back from the ERP in near real time. Note that most companies will likely have different services and applications used for API management, security policies, token validations, routing and other AWS components interacting with AS400Gateway for AWS.

**Prerequisites for use case:**

1. Salesforce account
2. Lambda functions
3. SNS topic
 
**Steps to create lambda function in AWS and configure cloudwatch:**


**Steps to create SNS topic:**

Go to Simple Notification Services&rarr;click on Topics&rarr;Create Topic&rarr;select Type as standard&rarr;name e.g (as400Topic)&rarr;set other properties if you want&rarr;click on create topic.

**create subscription for sns topic:**

Click on Create Subcription&rarr;select protocol(e.g. AWS Lambda)&rarr;Enter a valid AWS Lambda ARN (for example, arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:MyLambdaFunction)&rarr;After your subscription is created, you must confirm it.&rarr;set bother properties according(Optional)&rarr;click on Create Subscription

Considering an use case with Salesforce is a source system whenever we create a record in salesforce we use Apex classes in salesforce to fetch the record and push to API gateway since AS400 gateway doesnâ€™t understand the request coming from Salesforce we use Lambda function in between Salesforce and API gateway to format the input in AS400 consumable format.
We do necessary operations in AS400 gateway and response will be push to SNS topic Lambda function pick the messages from SNS topic and update response back to the salesforce.
